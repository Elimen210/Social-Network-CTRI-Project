# Social Network CTRI Project

Welcome in the Social Network CTRI Project. Here I'm creating my first website project. If you want to tip me. Check out my paypal, and my social network accounts too.

To run the project, first you must get python (at least the 3.9) and django. 

Also, to make  the project functional, just run these commands:
"pip install django-allauth django-crispy-forms", "pip install Pillow"

To run the server, run the following command:
"python manage.py runserver"

If you have any issue about the running of the server or just about installing environments, just check out "requirements.txt" and don't forget to run this command "python -m pip install --upgrade pip"
