# Guetto

Welcome in my First Social Network project. Here I'm creating my first website project. 
Guetto is a social web app project allowing gabonese people to be notified and react on the changes CTRI has been making since the end of 2023.


To run the project, first you must get python (at least the 3.9) and django. 

Also, to make  the project functional, just run these commands:
"pip install django-allauth django-crispy-forms"
and:
"pip install Pillow"

To run the server, run the following command:
"python manage.py runserver"

If you have any issue about the running of the server or just about installing environments, just check out "requirements.txt" and don't forget to run this command "python -m pip install --upgrade pip"
 
If you want to tip me. Check out my paypal, and my social network accounts too.
